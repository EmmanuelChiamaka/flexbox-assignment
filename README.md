## A three column preview card.

This project was built with basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

## The task
You are meant to build the exact image you find on your screen making sure that users are able to view your project perfectly fine no matter the size of their screen.

Also you should endeavour that the hover states of each buttons are active.

## My process
I worked with;
Semantic HTML5 markup

CSS custom properties and 

Flex box. Meanwhile you can choose to work with other things as the case may be, e.g CSS grid.


## What I learnt while building this project

While building thus project I learnt more about flexbox and CSS properties which is a very good one for me. Also I came to realize that this project can be built using different wats depending on the one your are more better at.

## Deploying your project

There are a lot of good sites one can use to host a website which includes the free and paid ones. But then, I recommend you using the netlify site because of its fast and reliable services it provides and its FREE!!!


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
